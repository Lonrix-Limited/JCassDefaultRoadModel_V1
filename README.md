# JCassDefaultRoadModel
 Second Generation Default Road Network Model for Cassandra. This repository contains the code for a purely C# based domain 
 model for Road Networks to run in Juno Cassandra. This project should not be confused with the first version of the Cassandra
 Default Road network model which is built using JFunctions. That (first version) model relies purely on setup expressions for 
 JFunctions and is held in a different repository at fritzjoostenz account.
